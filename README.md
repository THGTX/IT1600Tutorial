## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of deploying a honeypot. A honeypot is a security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. It can be a valuable tool for understanding and mitigating potential security threats.

### Prerequisites

- A server or virtual machine to host the honeypot
- Basic knowledge of the Linux command line
- Administrative access to configure firewall rules

## Step 1: Choose a Honeypot Software

There are various honeypot solutions available. For this tutorial, we'll use Honeyd, a lightweight honeypot daemon.

### Installation on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install honeyd
